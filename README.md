# NaqshSaz

NaqshSaz is a **Iranian** windows software to design Rug/Carpet design. (Version 10)

If you want to test the software or check it, maybe you need a sample Rug design. You can download some sample designs at [https://github.com/BaseMax/NaqshSaz-Designs](https://github.com/BaseMax/NaqshSaz-Designs).

> This software is a bit old, it's used some years ago by rug designers. but it's out to date for now.

By the way, probably you are not allowed to download/copy/and use this software free without a license.

I'm not sure, I think the creator website is unreadable too.
